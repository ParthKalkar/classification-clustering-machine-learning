# classification-clustering-machine-learning
In this project, I solved several tasks on classification and clustering. There are two theoretical questions on K-means clustering and SVM. Additionally, there are two practical tasks on Ensemble Learning and CNN. 

It also has a bonus task on GANs

## Ensemble Learning
In this task, we will use some network layer features such as Duration, Number of packets, etc. to build a machine learning classification model that will detect Android malware applications, using app features. (More info in the _problem_statement_ file)

## CNN
In this task, we are going to implement CNN for calculating human iris center. This CNN architecture is proposed in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8803121 as a fully convolutional network which consists of a base network and auxiliary network. (More info in the _problem_statement_ file)

## GAN
In this task, we will generate _Fake Faces_ using GANs.

## Code
It can be found in the files named _CNN_.ipynb_ , _Ensemble_Learning.ipynb_ , _GAN.ipynb_

## Problem Statement 
It can be found in the file named _ML_A2.pdf_

## Theoretical questions
It can be found in the file named _ML_A2_Theory.pdf_

## Datasets
All the necessary datasets have been provided with necessary links in the problem statement file

## Run
To run the code: 
1. Download the zip
2. Extract it 
3. Use https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index
4. Upload the notebook and datasets
5. Run each cell

## Results
Check the notebook with code, the cells were ran already and they have some output
